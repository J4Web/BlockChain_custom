## Background

Cardinal staking encompasses a suite of contracts for issuing and staking NFTs and FTs. The simple program is a stake pool that tracks total stake duration. In addition, there is an implementation of a token minting reward distributor. Cardinal staking works well with any standard NFT collection and also composes with other programs in the Cardinal NFT infrastructure ecosystem.
